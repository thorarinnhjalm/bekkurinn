# Session Summary 2026-01-05

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a user-friendly Dashboard to greet parents.
- Fix navigation and redirects to point to the new Dashboard.
- Ensure the feature is deployed to Vercel (via GitHub).

## 🔨 Changes Implemented

### 1. **New Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)**
Created `app/[locale]/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` which serves as the new home screen.
- **Greeting:** Personalized "Góðan daginn" with user's first name.
- **Latest News:** Fetches and displays the pinned or most recent announcement.
- **Upcoming Events:** Shows the next 2 tasks/patrols directly on the home screen.
- **Birthdays:** Highlights upcoming birthdays for the near future.
- **Localization:** Full Icelandic translations added to `messages/is.json`.

### 2. **Navigation & Routing Updates**
- **Bottom Navigation:** Added "Heim" (Home) as the first tab in `BottomNav.tsx`.
- **Redirects:**
  - Root (`/`) now redirects to `/dashboard`.
  - Login success now redirects to `/dashboard`.

### 3. **Deployment**
- **Build Verification:** Successfully ran `npm run build` locally.
- **Git Push:** Configured remote `origin` to `https://github.com/thorarinnhjalm/bekkurinn.git` and pushed all changes to `main`.
- *Note:* Manual Vercel CLI deployment failed due to missing auth token, but the Git push should trigger an automatic deployment if connected.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Verify the automatic Vercel deployment completes successfully.
- Test the Dashboard with real user data once configured.
